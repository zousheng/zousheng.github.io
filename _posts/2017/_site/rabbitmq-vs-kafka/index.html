<p>###Kafka VS Rabbitmq</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Message queue is a well known architectural pattern that provide an asynchronous communication protocol. It means that sender and receiver of the message are completely detached, they do not need to interact with a queueing system at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>####MQ makes message queues (or message brokers) very useful for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decoupling of services</li>
  <li>painless scaling</li>
  <li>backpressure management</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Kafka</code>: - high-throughput distributed messaging system</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">RabbitMQ</code> - reliable message broker (AMQP based)</p>

<p>| Feature | RabbitMq | Kafka |
| :—         |     :—:      |          —: |
| ` what is it<code class="highlighter-rouge">   |  RabbitMQ is a solid, mature, general purpose message broker that supports several standardized protocols such as AMQP      | Apache Kafka is a message bus optimized for high-ingress data streams and replay   |
| </code> Primary use<code class="highlighter-rouge">   |  High-throughput and reliable background jobs, communication and integration within, and between applications.      | Build applications that process and re-process streamed data on disk    |
| </code> routing approach<code class="highlighter-rouge">   |  rich: topic -&gt; direct,topic,headers,fanout      | simple: topic -&gt; Consumer Group    |
|</code> throuput / 1 pc<code class="highlighter-rouge">     | 20000 msg/sec      | 100000 msg/sec     |
| </code>client SDK support<code class="highlighter-rouge">    | multiple languages      | multiple languages      |
| </code>message delay<code class="highlighter-rouge">    |  μs      | ms      |
| </code>federated queues<code class="highlighter-rouge">    |  can be use to migrate cluster      | kafka mirror-maker have same function     |
| </code>availability and failover<code class="highlighter-rouge">    |    HA with mirror queue    | HA with replica      |
| </code>message lost<code class="highlighter-rouge">   |   under control    | Under control after 0.11      |
| </code>message duplicated<code class="highlighter-rouge">    |    under control    |1） not avoidable prior to 0.11 because of at lease once semantics, 0.11 introduced exactly once semantics 2）kafka stream     |
| </code>Order Message<code class="highlighter-rouge">    |  Exclusive Consumer or Exclusive Queues can ensure ordering      | Ensure ordering of messages within a partition     |
| </code>message priority<code class="highlighter-rouge">    |  supported      | not supported      |
| </code>message track<code class="highlighter-rouge">    |  supported      | not supported      |
| </code>Management and Operation Tools<code class="highlighter-rouge">    |  supported as plugin     | not supported (need to install 3rd party tool e.g. kafka-manager)    |
| </code>scalibility`    | Depends on the consumer,  you can add many consumers as you want, and there is no limit in theory      | Depends on the partition number, eg: 500 partitions, only 500 threads can consume from the topic, not meaning to add more threads.      |</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Conclusion is simple:</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Kafka is good for high throuput scenario</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RabbitMQ is good for reliable and flexible topic routing scenario ((surely, rabbitmq can also handle large throuput, but it needs more machines compred with kafka.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>###Our rabbitmq use case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Notification center service</code>’</p>

    <p>Once message arrives, will notify client</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Why Rabbitmq in Notification center</code></p>

    <p>Rabbitmq is mature, and developer is veryfamaliar with python + rabbitmq, and rabbitmq is reliable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This function can be implemented with kafka as well, but developer thinks rabbitmq is much easier, and the exchange routing strategy is more flexsible.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-rabbitmq-use-case">Other rabbitmq use case</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">User order priority in shopping mall</code></p>

    <p>e.g.: pub A -&gt; Rabbitmq -&gt; consumer B</p>

    <p>consumer B get all the orders from rabbitmq to handle, B can take priority of the order from VIP customer, this makes sense.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Note: There are only two hard problems in distributed systems</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Exactly-once delivery</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Guaranteed order of messages</li>
    </ol>
